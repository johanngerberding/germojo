# GerMojo 

I want to build my own alexa kinda thing called Mojo, a chatbot that you can talk to in German, hence the name GerMojo. Let's start checking out some cool german language models and then dive into the audio stuff.

# Ideas 

* use a small mistral model for language and Q&A 
* distil-whisper for speech to text ?
* text to speech ?? I have to do some research here
