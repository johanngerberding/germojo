# Mojo Chat 

I want to build my own alexa kinda thing called Mojo, a chatbot that you can talk to in German, hence the name Mojo Chat. Let's start checking out some cool german language models and then dive into the audio stuff.

## Ideas 

* use pyaudio to record what you say 
* use whisper for speech to text 
* LLM for answering 
* text to speech 
* pyaudio for output

* how to really let it run continuously to have a conversation? 

## Personality 

Mojo should be a funny and smart assistant that you can ask stuff that you are interested in.
